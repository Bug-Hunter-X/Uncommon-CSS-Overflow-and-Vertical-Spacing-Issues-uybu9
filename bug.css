The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a potential issue:  .element { width: calc(100% - 20px); padding: 10px; } This might cause unexpected horizontal overflow if the element's content is too wide, as the padding is added after the width is calculated.  Another example: Using a percentage value for line-height on an element containing images can lead to unpredictable vertical spacing.  The line-height percentage will be applied to the elementâ€™s font-size, but not to the images within it. Thus the images and text wouldn't align as intended.
